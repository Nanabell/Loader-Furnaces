## Loader Furnaces
Loader Furnaces are Furnaces that take a lot of power but will be able to keep up with Loaders from [LoaderRedux](https://github.com/Yousei9/Loader-Redux)  

Loader Furnaces are not cheap as they require a lot of power and will require **more** electric furnaces as if you built a full smelter setup.  
At the start of the game, the mod will try to discover all smelting recipes which only have a single item output and add a belt optimized Loader-furnace version of it.

## Bugs
It might be that some smelting recipes won't show up due to how Factorio handles the mod loading, if a mod is loaded after Loader-Furnaces the recipes will not be discovered.
