## Loader Furnaces
Loader Furnaces are Furnaces that take a lot of power but will be able to keep up with Loaders from [LoaderRedux](https://github.com/Yousei9/Loader-Redux)  

Loader Furnaces are not cheap as they require a lot of power and will require **more** electric furnaces as if you built a full smelter setup.  
Essentially Loader furnaces are just very fast furnaces that are optimized to work well with loaders so feel free to use em for what ever you like


Loader Furnaces also support [bob's logistics](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Bobingabout/boblogistics) for even faster furnaces & [bob's tech](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Bobingabout/bobtech) for tweaked research costs
